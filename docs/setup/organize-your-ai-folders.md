# Organize Your AI Folders

## Core Idea

Instead of mixing everything into one folder, the system is split into 3 clear layers:

- **AI_CORE** — running engines (ComfyUI, LM Studio, Ollama)
- **AI_VAULT** — permanent models (LLMs, diffusion, embeddings)
- **AI_TOOLS** — helper scripts & utilities

> This avoids duplication, keeps models stable, and makes tools interchangeable.

## Final Folder Structure

```
D:\AI\
│
├── AI_CORE
│   │
│   ├── ComfyUI
│   │   ├── venv
│   │   ├── custom_nodes
│   │   └── ComfyUI (git repo)
│   │
│   ├── LM Studio
│   └── Ollama
│
├── AI_VAULT
│   │
│   ├── models
│   │   ├── llm
│   │   ├── diffusion
│   │   └── embeddings
│   │
│   └── datasets
│
├── AI_WORKSPACE
│   │
│   ├── workflows
│   ├── input
│   └── output
│
└── AI_TOOLS
    │
    ├── scripts
    ├── converters
    └── utilities
```

> This structure separates runtime (CORE), permanent assets (VAULT), and automation tools (TOOLS).

## How It Works (Conceptually)

```
          +----------------------+
          |      AI_CORE         |
          |  (Runs Models)       |
          |----------------------|
          | ComfyUI             |
          | LM Studio           |
          | Ollama              |
          +----------+----------+
                     |
                     v
          +----------------------+
          |      AI_VAULT        |
          |  (Permanent Data)    |
          |----------------------|
          | LLM models          |
          | Diffusion models    |
          | Embeddings          |
          +----------+----------+
                     |
                     v
          +----------------------+
          |   AI_WORKSPACE       |
          | (Inputs / Outputs)   |
          +----------------------+

          +----------------------+
          |     AI_TOOLS         |
          | (Converters etc.)    |
          +----------------------+
```

## Why This Structure Works

- **Separation of concerns**: engines, data, and tools are independent
- **No model duplication**: VAULT is single source of truth
- **Safe upgrades**: CORE can be deleted/reinstalled without losing models
- **Scalable**: new AI apps slot into CORE without restructuring everything

## File Access Model (Important)

Models in AI_VAULT are:

- Read-only during inference
- Loaded into RAM/VRAM by AI_CORE apps
- Not modified during normal usage

> File conflicts only happen if multiple tools try to download/write into the same model directory. Inference itself is safe.

## Rules for Stability

- Only one system should manage downloads into AI_VAULT (or disable auto-downloads)
- Keep outputs separate from models
- Do not mix caches with VAULT
- Avoid syncing AI_VAULT with OneDrive or cloud folders

## Design Philosophy

Think of it like a real system:

- **AI_CORE** = engines (like engines in a machine)
- **AI_VAULT** = fuel & parts (models)
- **AI_WORKSPACE** = factory output (images, prompts, results)
- **AI_TOOLS** = maintenance tools

> The goal is modularity: any engine can be replaced without touching your data.
